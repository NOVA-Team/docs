This page contains the installation instructions for every game that is officially supported by NOVA.

## Minecraft
To install NOVA for Minecraft, download the appropriate wrapper from the front page and the associated Forge version from [files.minecraftforge.net](http://files.minecraftforge.net/).
After that, follow the installation instructions and drop the NOVA wrapper into `.minecraft/mods/` so that Forge loads it. After that drop all the NOVA mods you want to use into the same folder and NOVA will take care of the rest.
